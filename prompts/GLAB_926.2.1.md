# Mastering the Pillars of Prompting in the World of “Text Translation”

## Task 1

- Write a prompt that provides clear and detailed instructions to the AI on how to address this problem in a professional manner.

### Prompt

- You're a helpful and professional tech assistant. You're job is to respond to the user's inquiries delimited in quotes:

"I can't connect to the company VPN from my home office. Every time I try to log in, I get an error message saying, 'Unable to establish a connection.' I've tried restarting my computer and my router several times, but nothing seems to work. I need VPN access to get to some files and systems for a project that's due soon, so this is pretty urgent. Please help me fix this ASAP."

## Task 2

- Write a prompt that instructs AI to recommend the best formatting for the flyer in the translated output

### Prompt

- Translate the following marketing flyer into German, keeping all bullet points, headers, and formatting intact:
  Product Features:
  High-quality material: Our products are crafted from top-tier materials, ensuring durability and satisfaction.
  Affordable prices: Enjoy premium quality without breaking the bank. We believe in offering value for your investment.
  Eco-friendly production: Committed to sustainability, our manufacturing processes prioritize environmentally friendly practices.
  How to Order:

  Add your desired products to the cart.
  Proceed to checkout and enter your shipping details.
  Choose your payment method and confirm your order.

## Task 3

- Write a prompt that includes an example to help the AI maintain consistency in tone and terminology. You could provide an example of texts that carry the tone that you desire, and make sure that in your prompt specifies the type of tone that you want as a result. When creating your prompt, instruct the AI to translate the text into your target language (e.g., Spanish) and provide the desired tone you want the translation to have (e.g., formal, technical, friendly). Then, provide a sample text that reflects this tone so that the AI knows what to aim for.
  1. Open the Application
     Launch the application from your desktop by double-clicking the icon.
  2. Access the Settings Menu
     Click on the 'Settings' option located in the top-right corner of the application window.
  3. Enter License Key
     In the 'License Key' field, enter your 25-character license key.
  4. Select Preferences
     Choose your preferred language from the 'Language' dropdown menu.
  5. Save Changes
     Click the 'Save' button to apply your changes.

### Prompt

```
1. Open the Application
     Launch the application from your desktop by double-clicking the icon.
  2. Access the Settings Menu
     Click on the 'Settings' option located in the top-right corner of the application window.

The inquiry is delimited in quotes:

"I can't connect to the company VPN from my home office. Every time I try to log in, I get an error message saying, 'Unable to establish a connection.' I've tried restarting my computer and my router several times, but nothing seems to work. I need VPN access to get to some files and systems for a project that's due soon, so this is pretty urgent. Please help me fix this ASAP."

## Task 4

- You need to translate a lengthy user manual from English to Japanese. The manual covers various features of a software application and includes multiple sections with technical terms, diagrams, and user instructions. To ensure accuracy and consistency, the translation needs to be handled in steps, focusing on different parts sequentially.

### Prompt

- "Translate the following user manual from English to Japanese. The manual covers various features of a software application, and includes technical terms, diagrams, and user instructions. Please translate it in steps to ensure accuracy and consistency. Start with the 'Introduction' section, then proceed sequentially through each major section: 'Installation,' 'User Interface Overview,' 'Feature Breakdown,' and 'Troubleshooting.' Pay close attention to the technical terms and ensure clarity for the end-user. Once one section is translated, review it before proceeding to the next to maintain consistency throughout the manual."

- Here’s a series of chained prompts to guide the translation process step-by-step from English to Japanese. Each section is translated individually for clarity and consistency:

---

**Prompt 1: Translate the Overview section**  
Translate the following "Overview" section of the user manual from English to Japanese, ensuring that the meaning is clear and the technical terms are accurately represented.  
Text to translate:  
"Overview

---

**Prompt 2: Translate the Installation section**  
Translate the following "Installation" section of the user manual from English to Japanese, ensuring that the instructions remain clear and easy to follow.  
Text to translate:  
"Installation

2. Double-click the file to start installation.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions."

**Prompt 3: Translate the Features section**

---

**Prompt 4: Translate the Troubleshooting section**  
Translate the following "Troubleshooting" section of the user manual from English to Japanese, ensuring clarity and consistency in the problem-solving instructions.  
Text to translate:

This approach breaks the task into manageable parts while maintaining clarity and consistency in the translation process.
