## Classification

Customer Review: I don't know where to begin. We had reservations for 7:00 but they seated us at 7:45. Then, no one came to our table for at least 30 minutes. Our appetizer and main course were mediocre. I did love the dessert, but that wasn't enough to change our experience.

Customer Review: I love this restaurant. The food is delicious and the service is excellent.

Site selection for expansion is a complex and multifaceted process.

However, the site is also located in a jurisdiction with a complex and time-consuming permitting process, and its distance from residential zones may necessitate higher wages to attract workers.

## Problem solving

- We are running a community program to teach children gardening skills. The program runs from June 1 to August 15. We want the children to be able to grow plants that will be ready for harvest by the time the program ends. First, identify a list of 10 plants that can be planted and grown in that time period. Include sources that support the time to harvest for each plant.

We want the children to grow three plants. These plants should be as different from each other as possible. So next, choose three plants from the list that will provide the children with this variety.
