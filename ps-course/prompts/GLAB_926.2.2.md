## Task

- Scenario Example: “Generate a social media post for a new eco-friendly water bottle targeting young professionals.”

## Task

- Task: Learners are to select one prompt from Activity 1 and apply optimization techniques.
  Test the optimized prompts using an AI tool and record the responses.
  Refine the optimized prompts based on the AI’s responses.
  Encourage experimentation with different phrasings, contexts, and details.

## Task 3

- Task: Learners will create new prompts rather than refining or reusing prompts from earlier tasks. Specifically, they will work with the new scenario provided:

  Example: “Develop a step-by-step guide for creating a sustainable home office setup, including tips for reducing waste and improving energy efficiency.”

  Prompt Chaining: Link multiple prompts together to get more coherent, detailed responses.
  Few-shot Learning: Provide the AI with a few examples to guide its understanding of the desired response.
  Multi-turn Dialogue: Craft prompts that allow the AI to engage in back-and-forth conversation, refining responses over time.
